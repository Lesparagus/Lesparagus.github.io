<h1>section 1</h1>
<h2>section 1.1</h2>
<p>My name is Alex, I'm 19, and I never learned how to use the command line. I like cats, board games, and positive energy. I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas.
Now I have started a new line in the html file without creating a new paragraph. I wonder what that does?

I skipped a line before starting this line. Does this have an effect?</p>
<p>I closed the old p tag and started a new one. What does that do?</p>

<h2>section 1.2</h2>
<p>my cat is named Neo</p>

<h2>section 1.3</h2>
<p> I like <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/drama/heirs-game/list?title_no=1445">WEBTOONs</a>.</p>
