<p>"I'm so bored! What should we do?" Here are some card games you can make me play if you hear me say this!</p>
<h2>Indian BS</h2>
<p>My friend taught me this enjoyable BS variant. It lets you lie much more aggressively than regular BS and ends much faster.</p>

<p>The goal of this game is to play all your cards. At the start of the game, deal the cards as evenly as possible to the players, and choose someone to take the first turn of the first round, after which players take turns in order.</p>

<p>On your turn, you can play cards, pass, or challenge. To play cards, put some cards from your hand face-down in the pile at the center of the table, and declare the number of cards played and their rank. In the first round, everyone has to declare aces. However, since the cards are face down you can play cards that don't actually match the rank you declared.</p>

<p>If you think the player before you was lying, you can challenge instead of playing. To challenge, flip over the last set of cards from the center pile (unlike normal BS, you can only challenge on your own turn). If any of those cards don't match the declared rank, then whoever played them picks up all the cards from the center pile and adds them to their hand. Otherwise, you pick up all the cards instead.</p>

<p>If you don't want to play or challenge, you can pass, which skips your turn. The round ends either after someone challenges, or everyone passes in a row. In the latter case, remove the cards in the center pile from the game. The first player of the next round is either the player who challenged, or the last player who played. If nobody played in the round, then the first player remains the same. Every round, the rank everyone has to declare goes up -- so the second round everyone declares twos, then everyone declares threes, and so on. After kings it loops back to aces.</p>

<p>Play continues in this way until someone runs out of cards and doesn't have to pick any up from a challenge. That player wins the game.</p>
